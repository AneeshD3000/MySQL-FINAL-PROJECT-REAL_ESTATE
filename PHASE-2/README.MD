 Phase 2

description: >
  This repository demonstrates SQL query mastery including DDL, DML, DQL, operators, clauses, aliases, and cascading rules. The file contains a variety of queries on existing tables and newly created tables.

highlights:
  - Demonstrates Data Definition Language (DDL) operations such as creating new tables, altering table structure, and setting constraints.
  - Includes Data Manipulation Language (DML) queries like inserting, updating, and deleting records from existing tables.
  - Showcases Data Query Language (DQL) operations such as SELECT statements, DISTINCT queries, aggregation functions, and joins.
  - Uses SQL operators including arithmetic, comparison, logical, and special operators like IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, and IS NULL.
  - Implements clauses like WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, HAVING, and LIMIT to filter and organize data.
  - Applies column and table aliases to make queries more readable.
  - Demonstrates cascading rules with ON DELETE CASCADE and ON UPDATE CASCADE for foreign key constraints.
  - Covers queries on existing tables: users, properties, agents, customers, property images, amenities, property features, transactions, appointments, property review, payments, invoices, loans, installment, commission, maintenance requests, tenancies, property documents, feedback, contracts, inspection, utilities, offers, ratings, and property insurance.
  - Includes queries using multiple operators, clauses, and aliases for practice and demonstration purposes.
  
usage:
  - Clone the repository to your local machine.
  - Open the SQL file in any MySQL client or editor.
  - Execute queries sequentially or selectively to observe results.
  - Modify queries to explore additional use cases or test cascading rules.

notes: >
  This Phase-2 file focuses on applying comprehensive SQL knowledge in a practical database scenario. All queries are tested in MySQL, and cascading, aliases, and operator usage are highlighted for learning and demonstration purposes.
